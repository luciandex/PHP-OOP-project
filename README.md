PROJECT PAGE: http://medicalcenter.c1.biz/

Project theme: MedPeople - Medical Centre Website;

Template used: https://themefisher.com/products/medic-medical-template/

The project have used a LAMP-Vagrant configuration (source: https://github.com/danieltoader/lamp-vagrant).
After the setup, into "www" directory, place all files from this repository.
In your browser, write 192.168.33.33 (or what you chose).

Please note that PHP 7.4 version was used (provision.sh was modified).

The MySQL database file (lamp_01.sept.2020.sql) can be imported in PHPMyAdmin.

Any improvement idea is welcome! :)
